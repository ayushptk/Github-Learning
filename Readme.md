  3. git checkout <branch name>
      used to move from one branch to another

      it is used to cgreate a new branch

  5. git branch -d <branch name>

      <--------------------Merging Code------------------------>   

  1. git diff <-branch name->
      it is used to compare commits branches files and more
      it show extra filess... which compare both branches..

  2. git merge <-branch name->
       using github 
       create a pr pull request..
       we can used them to merge with main branches..
      using cmd...
      git merge another branch name
       
  3. git pull origin main
      It is used to fetch n download the content from remote repo it means github repo..
